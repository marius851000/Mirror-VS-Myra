:dad:...It's no use. Ugh, why did I have to be the odd one out again...
:bf:beep!
:dad:Ah- hello? Who was that?
:bf:Beep skedap bep!
:dad:Aww, well aren't you a cute little guy...
:dad:Is there anything I could help you with, darling? I'm in the middle of something very important here...
:bf:bebeep!
::*You pointed to the odd book in the woman's hands.*
:dad:Oh, were you curious about my book? I wouldn't touch it if I were you, darling.
:dad:It's a highly potent spellbook. The academy grants them to magic users in training, like me!
:dad:That's why I'm out here, to practice before exams tomorrow. But right now, I'm in a bit of trouble...
:dad:You see, some of these spells require two people to work.
:dad:Unfortunately for me, I don't have many friends to practice with...
:dad:(...or any at all, for that matter...)
:dad:If I can't pull off these spells before finals tomorrow, I'll have to turn in this book for good. No more magic.
:dad:(I wonder if they'll at least let me keep the hat...)
:bf:beep skedap bap!
:dad:What was that, darling? I think I may have misheard you.
:bf:*You once again pointed to the book.*
:dad:You want to help me practice? That's so sweet of you, but...
:dad:Have you ever even performed any kind of magic before, darling?
:bf:bebap skedoo bep
:dad:Ehehee! I'm gonna take that as a no. 
:dad:In that case, darling, let me review the basics with you before we begin!
:dad:Repeat after me. 1, 2...
