:bf:*The three of you let out a witchy cackle together in the graveyard.*
:dad:Thank you so much, darlings! You two really are something special...
:dad:I wish all my study sessions could be like this one.
:dad:Singing spells into the night sky with friends for the first time...
:dad:Something about that fills my heart with a joy like no other! Eheheheee!
:dad:*The ghosts of the graveyard swirl around you, almost as if expecting to hear another song.
:dad:Well, would you look at that! Darlings, I think we have an audience!
:dad:Before we end the night, how about we give these ghosts and ghouls a little show?
